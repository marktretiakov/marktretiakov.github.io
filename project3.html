        <p>For the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), I worked with a team to design and build robots capable of completing complex challenges. My role included designing and integrating key systems such as pneumatics, electronics, motors, gearboxes, and drive systems. I was responsible for selecting and assembling components that optimized performance, including pneumatic actuators for efficient movement and motors for precise control. These systems were carefully tuned to meet the specific requirements of the competition, ensuring reliability and functionality. Our efforts culminated in winning the regional championships, a testament to our design and teamwork.</p>

        <p>Additionally, I contributed to the machining of custom parts, focusing on precision fabrication to ensure proper fit and performance. Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with team members, engaging in design reviews, testing, and troubleshooting. This experience strengthened my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of systems integration, teamwork, and the hands-on aspects of engineering in a competitive environment.</p>
